# Connect-4-Game
A replica of the classic connect four game made through Java.

 - Main.java is where the program should be run to start the program
 - The Start Screen contains rules and button to allow a new game to start
 - The Game Screen is the main game where connect four is played. You can only put discs that are stacked. Not where there is nothing underneath it
 - The End Screen shows who won the game as well as a button to allow a new game to start
 - Board.java contains the underlying game where it adds to the matrix and checks for win conditions of four in a row
